    <div class="clout clout2">
        <p>With more than a year of remote work experience, I've engaged with a diverse range of clients, projects and startups. Excelling in remote environments, I've conquered challenges through effective communication and collaboration, delivering exceptional results consistently.</p>
        <p>I embrace both well-established and smaller teams and startups because I take initiative and enjoy challenges. I'm excellent at fixing problems and seeing ideas through to completion. I prioritize user-centric design and have a creative and imaginative mentality. I specialize in creating visually attractive and functional user interfaces. My flexible design method, which includes phases for execution, assessment, and research, easily adjusts to the needs of the project.</p>
        <p>I foster open communication and teamwork, leveraging my technical proficiency in design tools and front-end development to challenges and learn continuously. I prioritize culture alongside product, believing a supportive and collaborative environment is key to success. I excel at tackling diverse design challenges and pushing boundaries. Always learning, I seek new experiences to improve.</p>
